# Free-Fall-Simulation-Program
This program simulates the free fall of an object under gravity and generates data on its vertical position over time. It calculates the object's height using the equation for free fall and writes the data to a file. Additionally, it provides a graphical representation of the object's trajectory, illustrating how height changes with time.

Animation Program
This program creates an animation to visually represent the trajectory of an object in free fall. By reading the generated data, it animates the object's descent over time, providing a dynamic view of how the object's height decreases. The animation helps in understanding the motion and the impact of gravity on the object's fall.

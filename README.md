# Free-Fall-Simulation-Program
This program simulates the free fall of an object under gravity and generates data on its vertical position over time. It calculates the object's height using the equation for free fall and writes the data to a file. Additionally, it provides a graphical representation of the object's trajectory, illustrating how height changes with time.
